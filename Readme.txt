Totemus Turtle is a attempt to bring Totemus to a 1.12 client with some of the 
features i use to love in the TBC and Wrath editions.  And is a learning LUA 
experience for myself.

I ripped it from a working version of Necronomicon, which  is a Necrosis lookalike.

So it will monitor weapon buffs, drop totems, and keep a timer of them all.

I have tried to include the Water SHield and Earth Shield speels, but no idea if they
work as of this stage i don't have a lvl 60

If i can figure them our future additions will be:
- Save last used totem to a right click option
- Swap between mana and health for the sphere.


Dependancies: Ace, (I have a copy to clone if you need it)

Blue/Turquois/Orange/Rose/Violet/X Textures are curtsey of Eliah, from
EU-Ner'zhul server and Necrosis LDC. Credits go to them.

CHANGELOG:

Version 0.1
- Got it to work
- Basic functionality
